            <h2><i>HAIR</i></h2>
        <p>Bad hair days are a bummer; that's a beauty truth. But they are no joke: According to a Redbook poll, 74% of women say a bad hair day makes them feel less confident. So, when your hair is in good shape, it undoubtedly looks better, and the chances of that happening are far less likely— or at least less frequent.

            <h2><i>SKIN</i></h2>
            <p>Whether you take a minimal approach to your beauty routine or devour every skincare and makeup tip you can get your hands on, one thing remains universal—we all want to know the best practices for achieving healthy skin. For the most part, we've got the basics covered by ensuring our daily routine consists of applying sunscreen, drinking plenty of water, and remembering to remove our makeup before bed. However, these days, it seems there's always a new ingredient, technique, or product on the scene, with a bevy of skincare tips to go along with it.

            <p>Whether you're the type of person who religiously paints their nails as a form of self-care or someone who's constantly picking and biting at their cuticles, we all yearn for healthy, perfectly manicured nails. Well-groomed nails make you look instantly polished (pun intended!) and can even make hands appear more youthful

            <h2><i>DIET</i></h2>
            <p>A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance.
                Children who don’t get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections.
                They can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood.

            <h2><i>WORKOUT</i></h2>
            <p>Whether people engage in light exercises, such as walking, or high intensity activities, such as uphill cycling or weight training, regular exercise provides many benefits for the body and mind.
               Having a clear goal in mind, choosing activities that bring excitement and enjoyment, and exercising with friends and family can all help build motivation to exercise.
